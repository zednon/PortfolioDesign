          <h2>These are two of my clients stories</h2>
          <h3>Client 1 </h3>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="row g-0">
              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8"></p>Gender: Male<br>

                Disability: Psychiatric (Paranoid Schizophrenia) <br>
                
                Job: Cleaner <br>
                
                Benefits: Yes<br>
                
                </p></div>
              <div class="col-6 col-md-4"><img src="images/cleaner.jpg" alt="image of someone cleaning the floor with a mop" class="box"></div>
            </div></div>
            <p><br>I worked with this client until he passed away. He was nervous to get a job at first when I started working with him. He was worried about hours and losing his benefits and housing. I researched with him ways to work and keep his benefits. His work site was very understanding and allowed him to take off to lower his pay so he could keep his benefits. However he did have some over payments. 
              </p>
              <p><br>SSDI allows people to go 2x over their benefits and keep there full payment amount. 2 more times and they don’t get their SSDI payment that month. If it happens again they lose their benefits. 
             </p> 
             <p><br>He worked a job that paid employees once every 2 weeks. Due to the calendar, two times a year employees received 3 paychecks. This client would earn over the federal income limits for SSDI. It also could impact his housing, and medical benefits. In one of the times he went over by $40. He lost his SSD. We requested a fair hearing and a trial date was set. 
             </p> 
              <p><br>It was a chance for him to go before a judge and plead his case to keep his benefits. I researched ways for him to show medical related expenses as a reason he went over. The judge agreed and he was able to keep his benefits. I also assisted they client by keeping track of his pay calendar. I would meet with him and his manager and work out a plan to keep his benefits. 
              </p> 
           <p><br>   At the end of his life, I developed a relationship with his case manager to help with the benefit managements. When my client became ill I helped him put in a request for medical leave from his job. He was paid $15 an hour. Due to this reason he had limit his hours one day a week or risk putting himself well above the income limits. I worked with his employer’s HR department to ensure he was only paid a max of 16 hrs per week for the Family Medical Leave. </p>
